Program Description: This program combines the contents of multiple binary files into one combined
file which is created when executing and named "combined.txt". It is executed with:
"./combineFiles -a a.test -e2 b.test -s12 c.test" for example.

Technical Specifications/Limitations: The specifications of the first/last n digits is limited to a 10-digit number. This seems like a reasonable limitation.
